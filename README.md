# GMT-Fitness 

GMT-Fitness (Gain, Maintain and Trim) is a wep application that allows you to have all of workout and nutritional solutions in one place. We want to provide you with the right workouts and recipes in order to support your healthy lifestyle. We are using two API's (YouTube for the workout videos and Edamam for the recipes). When you search for a video you are going to receive five different videos coming from some of the best YouTube fitness channels, each video is extremely relevant and they offer quality content. When you search for a recipe it will take into consideration which one of our pages you are browsing from (Gaining, Maintaining and Trimming) before it provides you with the recipes, that way you receive meals that have the appropiate calory count for your situation. We also added a subscribe bar at the bottom of the page and a contact form, this data is being stored in Firabase.
