                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To most people's surprise it is actually quite the process in
                        order to have lasting, healthy
                        gains. It is recommended increasing your caloric intake and also increasing the amount you're
                        lifting in the gym in order to start to see those changes. Like losing weight, you have to
                        consider your caloric intake to your caloric output but to gain, you would need to be consuming
                        more than you are burning. </p>
                    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether you are active in the gym or simply inactive, you still
                        have
                        to take in account that you burn a minimal amount of calories daily. Therefor, you would still
                        need to consume over the minimum amount of calories needed to survive throughout the day in
                        order to see gains. Click <a href="../Group-Project/gain-page.html">here</a> for suggested

                <div class="p">
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more common goal of individuals getting into their fitness
                        journeys would be to lose weight, or
                        as well call it, trim down! With the right mindset and determination, one can do so by simply
                        eating right and working out with light to moderate weights and cardio. Trimming down body fat
                        means taking in fewer calories than what you are burning off on a daily basis, whether you are
                        extremely, mildly or barely active. </p>
                    <p>
                        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Healthy weight loss is strategic and a process. One wouldn’t want
                        to deprive themselves of basic needs so, they would aim for a balance of proper nutrition and
                        exercise. A helpful method to find out how many calories you need to consume daily based on your
                        physical activity would be the Harris Bennedict Equation.

                    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maintaining down to the core is not easy, as people's day-to-day,
                        week-to-week and even
                        month-to-month activities can vary and often change. In order to maintain, balance is key!
                        Balance of caloric output to caloric intake can be done so by tracking your activities and practicing healthy eating and exercise habits. Overall, the ratio should be
                        the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For anyone starting or following their fitness journey, one should
                        take into account the
                        nutritional value of the calories you are consuming. For example, a calorie is simply put, a
                        measure of energy. Each gram of protein contains 4 calories, each gram of carbohydrate contains
                        4 and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. Mindful eating & a little old school calorie
                      counting can be useful when aiming to maintain. See suggested workouts and recipes for
                        maintenance <a href="../Group-Project/maintain-page.html">here</a>. </p>
